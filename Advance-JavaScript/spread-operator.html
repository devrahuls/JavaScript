        /* In Rest, we always gives the value to rest argument as seperately.
        But, Now ! In Spread-operator we can include an Array as a rest-operator argument.

        Spread Operator - allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

        The main difference between rest and spread is that the rest operator puts the rest of some specific user-supplied values into a JavaScript array.
           But the spread syntax expands iterables into individual elements.
